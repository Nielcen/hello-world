Hi, Im Ryan. Just a guy living in the rainy, pacific northwest. I'm learning how to code, for the first time. I was a computer 'whiz' when I was a kid. I liked using software like "hotdog" to edit websites. At the time I didn't even realize that I was coding, I was just having fun. Now I want to learn this, for real.
